# Programming Study Repository

**This is the repository for my programming studies. I come here to learn and improve when I:**

- Didn't fully understand a concept
- Want to dive deeper into a topic
- Have free time (after finishing all projects and assignments)
- Couldn't answer questions correctly in class
- Feel my confidence has hit rock bottom
- Remind myself that even if I can't be as insanely skilled as other geniuses, mastering the basicsâ€”and a bit beyondâ€”is still valuable

I've never spent my time quite like this before. I think I genuinely enjoy learning to code. ðŸ˜„
